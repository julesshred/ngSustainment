# NgSustainment
I've included a small video demo

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Testing steps: (I would've also created Protactor tests for these funcionalities, with more time)
1) Test backend with Postman/Angular frontend for Insufficient funds when creating a debit transaction
	(account starts out with $500 balance)
2) Test backend with Postman/Angular frontend to create debit or credit transaction
3) Test backend with Postman/Angular frontend for viewing transactions
